# Dynamic Board Game Web Application with enhanced features
# ABSTRACT
In the realm of online gaming, this project introduces a novel 9x9 chess board 
platform, deviating from the conventional 8x8 standard to provide players with 
an expanded and enriched gaming experience. This project delves into the 
domain of online gaming, presenting a web-based board game application 
centered around a 9x9 board. The primary goal is to cultivate an engaging 
online gaming experience, incorporating features that not only enable real-time 
gameplay but also facilitate movement tracking and user interaction. Leveraging 
the capabilities of React JS, the system constructs a dynamic board game, 
recording player movements in a dedicated online MongoDB Atlas database. 
Unique to this application are additional functionalities, including a coin 
movement track sheet, timed game sessions, and robust movement validation 
with associated alerts. The envisioned system aims to elevate the overall gaming 
experience, providing players with a seamless, feature-rich platform for 
enjoying and preserving their gameplay history.
